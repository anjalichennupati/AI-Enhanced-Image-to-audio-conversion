# AI-Enhanced-Image-to-audio-conversion
This project addresses the critical need for secure multimedia data sharing by integrating image-to-audio encryption with advanced AI-based data-hiding techniques. Unlike conventional methods, this approach goes beyond translating pixels into sound waves. It holds promise in multimedia communication, artistic expression, and data protection. To enhance security, the project introduces AI-enhanced data-hiding techniques, leveraging adversarial training and reinforcement learning. This extra layer ensures resistance to unauthorized access and tampering. In summary, this project fuses image-to-audio encryption and AI-enhanced data hiding, aiming to revolutionize multimedia.
